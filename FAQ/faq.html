    <h1>FAQ's Of Life</h1>

        <div id="question">
<h2> How do you motivate yourself to get work done after trying many things and failing over and over again?</h2>
<i id="icon" class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
       </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Motivation is first just about taking that first step — just getting excited about something enough to get started. Then it’s about focusing on enjoying what you’re doing, right now, instead of worrying about how you’re going to get to a destination. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="main ">
        <div id="question">
<h2> What’s the habit requiring the least effort that makes the greatest difference?</h2>
<i id="icon" class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
       </div>
    <div class="answer">


        This will sound trite, but I’d say positive thinking. It’s not the easiest habit, as it requires that you start listening to your self-talk, and start telling yourself positive things instead of negative ones.   </div>
    </div>
    <div class="main ">
        <div id="question">
<h2>Why do we willfully and consciously engage in self-destructive habits while ignoring our better judgment?</h2>
<i id="icon" class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
       </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The pain of quitting is now, while the pain of continuing is much later, and so it doesn’t seem too bad. So the answer is to replace the bad habit with a good habit that you enjoy immensely, and focus on that enjoyment, right now, rather than the pain. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="main ">
        <div id="question">
<h2>What is your favorite low tech and high tech way to track progress on your habits?</h2>
<i id="icon" class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
       </div>
    <div class="answer">

        I’ve tried lots of high-tech trackers — from Joe’s Goals to The Daily Plate to the Daily Mile to Fit Day — but my current favorite is Daytum. It’s really easy to enter data, and you can display it publicly in many useful ways. People can look at my Daytum and see how I’m doing, and that motivates me to keep going.  </div>

    <div class="main ">
        <div id="question">
<h2>How can I become a “Morning Person”? I feel it’s a key to success.</h2>
<i id="icon" class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
       </div>
    <div class="answer">
        While I intentionally became an early riser, and I love it, it’s not really a key to success. It’s one way to find the time to pursue your dreams, and it’s the way I chose, but I know night owls (famously, Tim Ferriss) who find they’re much more productive in the middle of the night. Find what works best for you.   </div>
